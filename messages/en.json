    "text1": "When you buy a puppy from us, we place great importance on finding the right home for each individual. We gather interest and get to know potential buyers before deciding who will have the opportunity to purchase a puppy. We prioritize those who live nearby, as we want to maintain a good relationship even after the puppy has moved to its new home.",
    "text2": "The puppies grow up in a home environment and are carefully socialized before being delivered at the earliest at eight weeks of age. We are not just there at the beginning—we will be available with support and advice for a long time to come. Each puppy also receives a puppy package from Purina Pro Plan and our informative puppy handbook.",

  "About": {
    "title": "About us",
    "text1": "Bullworks is a small-scale kennel in southern Skåne. We are two siblings who were practically raised in the whelping box and have inherited a passion for dogs. With parents who breed under Kennel Moonstruck and Kennel Workable, the dog world has always been around us, but it wasn’t obvious that it would become our path. A few years ago, dogs started to take up more and more space in our lives, and now they are our greatest passion.",
    "text2": "We breed both solid and parti-colored Cocker Spaniels. Alexander focuses on parti-colored and Filippa on solid-colored. Our goal is to breed healthy, social, and well-built English Cocker Spaniels, with a focus on both health and temperament. For us, breeding is about love for the breed and preserving its wonderful qualities through carefully planned combinations. In 2023, we started Kennel Bullworks.",
    "text3": "The kennel name was inherited from our mother Christina Drottsgård and Karin Brostam Berglund, who registered it in 1992 with the intention of breeding Clumber Spaniels together. Even though no puppies were ever born under the name at that time, we now carry it with pride."
