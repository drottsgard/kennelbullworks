We gather interest and get to know potential puppy buyers before deciding who will have the opportunity to purchase a puppy. We prioritize those who live nearby, as we want to maintain a good relationship even after the puppy has moved to its new home.",

We are not just there at the beginningâ€”we will be available with support and advice for a long time to come. Each puppy also receives a puppy package from Purina Pro Plan and our informative puppy handbook.",
